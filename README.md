 This paper uses multiple linear regression to analyze 22 variables affecting life expectancy across 193 countries (2000–2015). Key predictors include health, economic, and social factors. The final model, with an adjusted R² of 0.771, accurately predicts life expectancy and highlights effective variable selection for real-world applications.
